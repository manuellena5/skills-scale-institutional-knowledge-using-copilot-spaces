# OctoAcme Project Management Docs — README

OctoAcme project management follows an iterative, customer-focused process that balances structured planning with agility and strong cross-team communication. This README provides a concise entry point to the process and links to all detailed guides used by OctoAcme for consistent delivery and continuous improvement.

## Process Summary
- Initiation: Define the problem, goals, success metrics, stakeholders, and initial timeline.
- Planning: Break the initiative into an actionable backlog, estimate scope, define Definition of Done (DoD), map dependencies, and create a release/milestone plan.
- Execution & Tracking: Run standups and delivery syncs, use a project board for visibility, follow small-PR conventions, and ensure CI/testing quality gates.
- Risk Management & Communication: Maintain a risk register, review and escalate risks regularly, and provide clear stakeholder updates.
- Release & Deployment: Standardize releases (patch/minor/major), meet pre-release checks, automate deployments when possible, and document rollback plans.
- Retrospective & Continuous Improvement: Capture learnings after sprints/releases, prioritize action items, and measure improvements over time.
- Roles & Personas: Clarify responsibilities across PMs, PdMs, Developers, QA, and Stakeholders to enable effective collaboration.
